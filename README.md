## constraints

* all lines either horizontal, vertical or both - no diagonal lines, no curves, etc.
* all angles straight
* main direction: top-to-bottom - that 
* loopbacks possible
* no arrows (direction is known and default) except loopbacks
* main skewer - default progression
* the further to the right - the less ideal the scenario
* deterministic: input A will always produce output B
