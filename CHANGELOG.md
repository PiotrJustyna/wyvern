## [0.3.2.0](https://github.com/PiotrJustyna/wyvern/tree/0.3.2.0) (2026-01-28)

It is imperative to the end user to see where in the input files they are making mistakes. Previous versions just informed the user that there is a lexing error in their input while the new version points out exactly where it was found. The change makes learning wyvern and working with it that much easier. I hope!
